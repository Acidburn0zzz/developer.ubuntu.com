# Web apps

Web apps are apps behaving like native apps but written using html5 apps development frameworks like Cordova, React Native, Electron. These app development frameworks can be used to create apps that will run across various Ubuntu devices from phone to desktop.

The documentation for web apps for Unity 8 on Ubuntu 16.10 is still work in progress and will be added here when available. To be kept up to date about the availability of the web apps documentation you can subscribe to our [phone mailing list] (http://canonical.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=56dac47c206ba0f58ec25f314&id=41b3983f71).

Web apps were originally launched on Ubuntu phones on Ubuntu 15.10. To develop web apps for Ubuntu phones please refer to this documentation.
