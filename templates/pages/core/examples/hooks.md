# Hook examples

A hook is an executable file that is called under a certain pre-configured condition. For example, a hook can ensure a database update occurs when a snap gets upgraded.

##Configure hook
Help users configure the port their webserver runs on.

[View the configure hook template code ›](https://github.com/ubuntu/snow-on-me-snap/blob/master/meta/hooks/configure)

In order to use this hook, your application will need to watch for changes in the config files generated by the configure hook. This can be done by adding a small procedure to your application.
