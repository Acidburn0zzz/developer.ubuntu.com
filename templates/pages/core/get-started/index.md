# Get started

Ubuntu Core is supported on a variety of chipsets, boards, SOCs and virtual machines, including Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c, Intel NUC, Intel Joule, Samsung Artik and KVM.

We will guide you through the steps of installing Ubuntu Core on these platforms.

## 1. Create installation medias

Whether you are using Ubuntu, Windows or Mac OS, you can follow these steps to write Ubuntu Core to an SD Card or a USB flash drive, that will allow you to boot or flash a board with Ubuntu Core.

## 2. Flash Ubuntu Core

Ubuntu Core can run standalone on a device or in addition to a classic Ubuntu 16.04 LTS install. While the former is the recommended way to install Ubuntu Core on production devices, the latter is useful to develop snaps directly on target.

* Flash Ubuntu Core on your board as a production or testing environment for snaps.<br>

* Install Ubuntu Classic to develop snaps directly on your device.<br>
