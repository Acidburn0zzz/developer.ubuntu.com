# Get started

Ubuntu Core is supported on a variety of chipsets, boards, SOCs and virtual machines, including Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c, Intel NUC, Intel Joule, Samsung Artik and KVM. This section will guide you through the steps of installing Ubuntu Core on these platforms.

## [1. Create installation medias ›](/core/get-started/installation-medias)

Whether you are using Ubuntu, Windows or Mac OS, you can follow these steps to write Ubuntu Core to an SD Card or a USB flash drive, that will allow you to boot or flash a board with Ubuntu Core.

## 2. Installation steps

Ubuntu Core can run standalone on a device or in addition to a classic Ubuntu 16.04 LTS install. While the former is the recommended way to install Ubuntu Core on production devices, the latter is useful to develop snaps directly on target.

### [Flash Ubuntu Core ›](/core/get-started/flash)

Flash Ubuntu Core on your board as a production or testing environment for snaps.

### [Developer setup ›](/core/get-started/developer-setup)

Install Ubuntu Classic to develop snaps directly on your device.
