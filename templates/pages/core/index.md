# Core

Ubuntu Core, a minimalist rendition of Ubuntu, is a lightweight, transactionally updated OS designed for deployments on embedded and IoT devices, cloud and more. It runs a new breed of super-secure, remotely upgradeable Linux app packages known as snaps.

The strict separation between kernel and device drivers, OS and applications means embedded engineers and application developers can easily work in parallel.
