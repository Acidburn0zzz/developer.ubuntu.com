# Tutorials

Tutorials are practical guides, with step by step instructions to achieve the most common development tasks. These tutorials cover a variety of topics from the getting started tasks to advanced topics. They provide an easy to follow, practical, instructive way of understanding some of the key Ubuntu Core concepts and more importantly to get help you build components of your solution.

Tutorials are still in beta. To get an early preview, you can access the offline version of the tutorials, packaged as a snap. To give us feedback or ask for specific tutorials, please [file a bug](https://github.com/ubuntu/codelabs/issues) on the project Github.

All tutorials are also available packaged up as a snap, this is particularly useful when organising events where accessing the Internet is difficult.

To get started, install the snap:

sudo snap install snap-codelabs
