# Troubleshooting

When building your device or managing a fleet of devices you might bump into issues. The Ubuntu community is renowned for the wealth of information you can find about various topics across a number of channels. Pick the one best suited to your taste and needs.

## Ask Ubuntu 
Use this as your first port of call to get answers for the most commonly asked questions. If you’re stuck, chances are that someone else has encountered the same problem and they can help. 

Take a look at the "ubuntu-core" tag for questions related to building and managing Ubuntu Core devices on Ask Ubuntu.

Take a look at the "snap" tag for questions related to building snaps on Ask Ubuntu.
