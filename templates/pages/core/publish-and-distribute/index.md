## Publish
In order to share your snaps for Ubuntu Core with the world, you need to publish them in a store. 

### 1. Create a store account

To publish snaps to the Ubuntu Store you will need to create an account on myapps.developer.ubuntu.com. This is your developer portal where you can customize how your snaps are presented, review your uploads, and control publishing.

### 2. Reserve a name for your snap

You can publish your own version of a snap, provided you do so under a name you have rights to.

### 3. Upload your snap

Before you upload your snap, have a quick look at your snapcraft.yaml file again. Two settings (grade and confinement) will define which channels you can release your snap to.

### 4. Release your snap

Uploading a snap doesnâ€™t make it immediately available for installation. You have to choose the channel(s) you want to release into.
