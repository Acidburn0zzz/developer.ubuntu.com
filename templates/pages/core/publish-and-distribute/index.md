# Publish and distribute

Package, release and distribute your snaps to your devices through the Ubuntu Store or your private store.

Snaps allow you to go from creation to instant publication in the release channel of your choice without leaving the command line.

You can also integrate the publication workflow into your CI process.  For example, you could release beta or daily builds to all users who subscribe to a specific release channel.

Ubuntu Core allows you to go to production with your own devices and branded store quickly.

Create your own store, automatically push updates to devices in the field, customise your kernel, and seed your own extra snaps on Ubuntu Core images.
