# Scopes
Scopes are home screens which source content from many different apps into one common theme or purpose. They are a component of the Unity 8 desktop shell available on various Ubuntu devices from phone to desktops, developed using a UI toolkit available through the Ubuntu SDK. Scopes can be used to give your users access to everything from movies and music to local services and social media, without having to go through apps. 

## Documentation 
The documentation for scopes for Unity 8 on Ubuntu 16.10 is still work in progress and will be added here when available. To be kept up to date about the availability of the scopes documentation you can subscribe to our [phone mailing list] (http://canonical.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=56dac47c206ba0f58ec25f314&id=41b3983f71).

Scopes were originally launched on Ubuntu phones using the Unity 8 desktop shell on Ubuntu 15.10. To develop scopes for Ubuntu phones please refer to this documentation.
