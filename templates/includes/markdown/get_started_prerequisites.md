## User account prerequisites

An Ubuntu SSO account is required to setup the first user on the board.

 1. Start by creating an [Ubuntu SSO account](https://login.ubuntu.com)
 2. Import an SSH Key into your Ubuntu SSO account [on this page](https://login.ubuntu.com/ssh-keys). Instructions to generate an SSH Key on your computer can be found [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys).
 3. You will need a keyboard, monitor or a serial cable plugged into the board to be able to go through the first boot process and complete device configuration.
